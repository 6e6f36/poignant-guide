On August 19, 2009 why the lucky stiff removed every trace of his work from the
Web, including his Poignant Guide to Ruby.

I've salvaged what I could, cleaned it up a bit and saved here. He released the
book under the [Attribution-ShareAlike license][cc].

There's a [Japanese translation of the book][jp], although I can't tell how up
to date it is.

The original soundtrack and PDF edition are also available in
[the download section][dl] on GitHub.
